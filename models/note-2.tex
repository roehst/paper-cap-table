\begin{document}

We have an Excel spreadsheet for a vesting term that shows how complicated it is to model a single stock plan security. We use it as the example for the vesting system and for the capitalization table example.

We also have a spreadsheet of funding rounds that we explore in the transaction tracing model.

We also have a new rationale underlying the model construction.
